    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>
    Bulbasaur is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker
    green patches. It has red eyes with white pupils and scleras and pointed,
    ear-like structures on top of its head. Its snout is short and blunt,
    and it has a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the
    upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three
    sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
    planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis
    as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
    </p>
    As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be
    distributed to new Trainers. Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur
    is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely
    loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to
    be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by."
     To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokémon
     and soothingly rocks it in the air. It is found in grasslands and forests
     throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter
     Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the
     ownership of a Trainer. It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will
     flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it
     struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year
     in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a
     Venusaur.
