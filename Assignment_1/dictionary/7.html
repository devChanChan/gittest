    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>
      Squirtle is a small Pokémon that resembles a light blue turtle. While it
      typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours
      in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip.
      Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long tail
      curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after
      birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a
      thick white ridge between the two halves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for
      protection or for sleeping, and its grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce
      water resistance when this Pokémon swims. Squirtle can spray foamy water
      from its mouth with great accuracy. In the past, Skull Bash was its signature
      move. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small
      ponds and lakes. The anime has shown that it can be found living on secluded
      islands with other members of its evolutionary line.
