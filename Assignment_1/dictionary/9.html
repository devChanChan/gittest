    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>
      Blastoise is a large, bipedal tortoise-like Pokémon. Its body is light blue
      and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a pale yellow
      underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and
      lower halves. Two powerful water cannons reside in the top sides of its shell.
      These cannons can be extended or withdrawn and can be used to assist in high-speed
      charges. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside,
      small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick and striated
      with three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one
      on the back. It has a stubby tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mega Blastoise, it develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with
      their own water cannon. The two cannons on its back are replaced by a single,
      central water cannon of greater size. This cannon extends forward over Mega
      Blastoise's head and is said to have a blast range of over 6 miles (10 km).
      Small ridges develop over its, now red, eyes and extend to its ears. The ears
      angle slightly backward and there is a small point on its chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back are capable of producing water
      blasts that can pierce steel and concrete. Blastoise deliberately makes itself
      heavy to withstand these powerful blasts, and it will crush its opponents with
      its bulk. It has two former signature moves, Skull Bash and Hydro Cannon. The
      anime has shown that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups
      of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds
      and lakes.
